## Project Background
Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. 
Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. 
Our team have been asked to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. 
The insights we discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
