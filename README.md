Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Our team have been asked to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights we discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

## Objective
To grow and become a larger player in smart device industry.

## Business Task
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

- The data has limitations: 
           a) Outdated
           b) very few records

## Data Cleaning
1. Loaded Dataset to R
2. Split Date & Time into separate columns
3. Removed duplicate and null values
4. Corrected data types

## Useful Insights

# Recommendations
- To reduce awake time in bed by 25% remind the user to go to sleep, when awake time in bed exceeds 20 mins.
- To increase very active minutes by 15% give a workout alert to the user everyday.
- To reach daily steps upto 10K remind users to take a walk every 15 min.
- Introducing the concept of leaderboard in Bellabeat App will create enthusiasm among the users to keep up the momentum.
